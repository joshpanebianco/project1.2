Project 1: SEI-36

Hello Code, an online community for people learning to code. This project is built with rails version 5 and the front end is using bootstrap 4. 

Some of the interesting features for this project are:

- Users can create custom communities with rules and posting guidelines.- Each user can upvote or downvote a post, with the upvote amount shown in real-time.- Users can add videos with iframes that display on the page.

- There are restrictions for accounts that create posts and those that only make comments.

This project helped me learn the differences between rails 5 and rails 6 and the reasons why some developers have a preference for either version.

Thank you to Alek and Joel for all of your help getting bugs fixed during the first project week.Â
